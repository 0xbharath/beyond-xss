# Beyond XSS

It's a series of articles all about web front-end security. Both Tranditional Chinese and English versions are available.

* Tranditional Chinese: https://aszx87410.github.io/beyond-xss/
* English: https://aszx87410.github.io/beyond-xss/en

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ npm i
```

### Local Development

```
# For traditional chinese 
$ npm run start

# For english version
$ npm run start -- --locale en
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.


### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

```
$ npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
